My personal web page has changed over the years. From a simple static HTML page to a react application. It is now more minimal and has a more powerful infrastructure. The technologies I use: `Next.js`, `shadcn/ui`, `react.js`. I also use `Raindrop APIs` for my bookmarks and `Unsplash APIs` for my photos. `Airtable APIs` to change my personal information whenever I want. I use a lot of APIs and this is what I've come up with as a jr for now. It will get better later.
